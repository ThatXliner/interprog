> **Note**
> If you're already using an RPC framework such as JSON-RPC or gRPC, you probably shouldn't be using this but instead implementing progress reporting within your existing framework. See [this StackOverflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/64352861/is-there-a-way-to-get-progress-messages-from-grpc-request) for ideas.
